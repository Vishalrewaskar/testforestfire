ðŸ”¥ Algerian Forest Fires - End-to-End ML Project
This project involves an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset, focused on predicting fire risk based on various weather and fire index factors. The project applies regression models, selects the best-performing model, and deploys it using a Flask web application.

ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights
âœ… Started an end-to-end machine learning pipeline
âœ… Applied various regression models to the dataset
âœ… Evaluated and selected the best-performing model
âœ… Saved the model using Pickle serialization
âœ… Deployed the model using Flask for real-time predictions
